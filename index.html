        <blockquote>“All pictorial form begins with the point that sets itself in motion...The point moves...and the
          line comes into being—the first dimension. If the line shifts to form a plane, we obtain a two-dimensional
          element. In the movement from plane to spaces, the clash of planes gives rise to body (three-dimensional) ...A
          summary of the kinetic energies which move the point into a line, the line into a plane, and the plane into a
          spatial dimension.”

      <div class="col-1">
        <p>This opening chapter presents the primary elements of form in the order of their growth from the point to a
          one-dimensional line, from the line to a two-dimensional plane, and from the plane to a three-dimensional
          volume. Each element is first considered as a conceptual element, then as a visual element in the vocabulary
          of
          architectural design.</p>
        <p>As conceptual elements, the point, line, plane, and volume are not visible except to the mind’s eye. While
          they
          do not actually exist, we nevertheless feel their presence. We can sense a point at the meeting of two lines,
          a
          line marking the contour of a plane, a plane enclosing a volume, and the volume of an object that occupies
          space.</p>
        <p>When made visible to the eye on paper or in three-dimensional space, these elements become form with
          characteristics of substance, shape, size, color, and texture. As we experience these forms in our
          environment,
          we should be able to perceive in their structure the existence of the primary elements of point, line, plane,
          and volume.</p>

        <p>A point marks a position in space. Conceptually, it has no length, width, or depth, and is therefore static,
          centralized, and directionless. As the prime element in the vocabulary of form, a point can serve to mark:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the two ends of a line</li>
          <li>the intersection of two lines</li>
          <li>the meeting of lines at the corner of a plane or volume</li>
          <li>the center of a field</li>
